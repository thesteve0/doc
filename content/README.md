# Template: User Guide  

This template is for Crunchy Data employees to use as a reference when creating a User Guide. The easiest way to use this is to download the repository and import the files/content into your own project.

This template is a collection of Markdown files. You should feel free to remove or add new files as you see fit. 

If you would like to add a new file (i.e. a separate page), make sure to follow the file naming convention: prefixed with a double digit to set the order (e.g. `09-`), dashes instead of spaces, and using the `.md` (or `.markdown`) extension. If necessary, change the number prefixes of the other files to apply a change in order.

## Before You Write

Ask yourself:

- What purpose does this serve?
- Who is going to read it? (Is there any chance that the person using this guide will be a complete beginner?)
- What does the reader need to know? How do you make it easy for them to find?
- Why should they care?
